# Task-2 - Using .gitignore and Tracking Files

## Objectives
- Set up a .gitignore file to exclude certain files or directories
- Verify that ignored files are not tracked by Git

## .gitignore
`.gitignore` is a file used to intentionally ignore certains files from being tracked by Git. Each line of the `.gitignore` specifies a pattern and all files matching the specified patterns will be ignored by Git.

## Examples of usage
- Ignoring **ENV** files that contain sensitive and confidential data such as credentials (`.env`)
- Ignoring configurations files generated by IDEs (`.vscode`)
- Ignoring files that are generated by package managers (`node_modules`)
- Ignoring build files and binaries that are compiled from the project (`.o` files)
- Ignoring log and debug files (`.log` files)

## Pattern Formats
- A blank line matches no files and is used as a seperator for better readability
- Lines starting with `#` act as comments
- `/` is used as a directory seperator.
- If `/` occurs in the beginning and/or middle of the pattern, then the pattern is matched relative to the current directory level of `.gitignore` file\
**EG:** `/reference/` matches `/reference/` directory but not `/doc/reference/` directory
- If `/` occurs only in the end of the pattern, then the pattern matches all directory at any depth relative to the current directory level of `.gitignore` file\
**EG:** `reference/` matches `/referene/` directory and also `/doc/reference/` directory
- `!` prefix is used to override any files that are ignored in previous patterns and reinclude them.
- `*` is used for matching anything except a slash\
**EG:** `*.txt` matches `a.txt` and `requirements.txt` but not `doc/a.txt`
- Leading `**/` matches in all directories\
**EG:** `**/a.txt` matches `a.txt` in all directories at any depth from the `.gitignore` file
- Trailing `/**` matches everything inside\
**EG:** `doc/**` matches all files in the `doc/` directory, relative to the `.gitignore` file, with infinite depth.
- `/**/` is used to match zero or more directories\
**EG:** `doc/**/reference.txt` will match `doc/reference.txt`, `doc/a/reference.txt` and also `doc/a/b/reference.txt`
